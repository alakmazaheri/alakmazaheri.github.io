            <p>I am an undergraduate student at Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering interested in mission-driven research and development at the intersection of engineering design, robotics, artificial intelligence, and computational neuroscience. For the past few years, I have been studying and experimenting with ideas for developing assistive technologies for people with physical disabilities.</p>
            <p>In high school, I became interested in brain-computer interfacing (BCI). Starting junior year, I worked on a project with the aim of controlling various robot manipulation and locomotion tasks via brainwaves. I built and programmed a life-size humanoid and robotic wheelchair and experimented with electroencephalography (EEG) for controlling them. This work exposed me to various topics including signal processing, natural language modeling, robot control, and system design.</p>
            <p>In college, my goal has been to broaden and deepen my understanding of both theoretical and practical issues pertaining to BCI while pursuing my undergraduate studies in mechanical engineering.</p>
            <p>In my first semester of freshman year, I initiated a research study on BCI with Professor Sam Michalka. Her expertise in neuroscience has been instrumental in shaping my work in this area since then. Under her supervision, I helped form a research group and assisted in setting up the Human Augmentation Laboratory (HAL), a space dedicated to neuroscience R&amp;D activities at Olin.</p>
            <p>In the Summer of 2017, I worked as a research assistant at HAL focusing on BCI, and concurrently assisted Professor Jon Adler in a psychology research project on narrative identity. My BCI research entailed using medical-grade EEG technologies for robust classification of various mental states. This also gave me an opportunity to study the theory and implementation of a few signal processing and machine learning techniques. The work with Professor Adler entailed coding verbal narratives from parents of a child on the autism spectrum for a variety of themes, including agency, communion, redemption, contamination, and coherence. Although this work was unrelated to BCI, the experience helped me hone my research skills pertaining to data collection, analysis, and interpretation using both qualitative and quantitative metrics.</p>
            <p>Further, the project-based curriculum at Olin has enabled me to invest time and effort to study several BCI-related areas including linear algebra, artificial intelligence, and user-oriented design, in the context of hands-on projects. In this website, I have highlighted a few of my project outcomes. Examples include developing the circuitry for an inexpensive EEG, studying the mathematical basis of Common Spatial Pattern analysis, programming an A.I. agent that operates using reinforcement learning, and designing and fabricating a compliant and tendon-driven robot hand.</p>
            <p>For the next two years, I will continue my BCI R&amp;D activities with an eye toward its theoretical foundations. I plan to attend graduate school to further deepen my technical knowledge, learn from active researchers in the field, and participate directly in the state-of-the-art BCI work. My ultimate goal is to build and transform technology into ubiquitous tools in the service of people with physical disabilities across the globe. </p>
