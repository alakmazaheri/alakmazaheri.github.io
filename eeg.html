            <p>The goal of this project was to design and build an electroencephalogram (EEG) that records brainwaves non-invasively through the scalp. Specifically, we were interested in distinguishing between relaxed and focused states of the user, which are frequently found to characterize various control modes in brain-computer interfaces. Our functional, relatively inexpensive EEG is a step towards a future of lower-cost, flexible solutions for the many people who cannot otherwise access such technologies.</p>


            <i> Project Details: </i>
            <p>A major challenge of recording neuroelectrical activity is decoding a noisy, small magnitude signal via filtering and amplification. We constructed a circuit with notch filtering to remove the surrounding powerline frequency (60 Hz) and both high and low pass filters to accentuate alpha and beta wave ranges (8-32 Hz). These have been found to correspond to relaxed and focused mental states, respectively.</p>

                <i>EEG circuit schematic. This circuit was used in conjunction with an Analog Discovery to record and visualize the signal.</i>
            </center>

            <p>Three electrodes were placed on the user via conductive paste: a grounding electrode on the earlobe, a reference on the mastoid, and a primary signal electrode on the occipitoparietal region of the scalp.</p>
            <p>In preliminary testing, the user was instructed to relax with their eyes closed, blink rapidly, clench their jaw, and focus while performing mental math.</p>
            <p>A 10 Hertz wave was observable via WaveForms in real-time during relaxed states. There was also a visible difference between relaxed states and muscle movements. This visual clarity gave a preliminary confidence in the data.</p>

            <div class="paddedline"> </div>

            <p>The recorded trials that followed consisted of six thirty-second blocks where the user was instructed to either relax with their eyes closed or perform a mental math task with their eyes opened.</p>
            <p>A Fast Fourier Transform was applied to the recorded trials in MATLAB, translating a time series response into the frequency domain. This allowed for a clearer analysis of alpha wave ranges.</p>

            <div class="paddedline"> </div>

            <p>The magnitude of alpha waves in the relaxed state are comparatively higher than those in the focused state. The amplitude peak around 10 Hz is a commonly observed phenomenon corresponding to the userâ€™s closed eyes.</p>
            <p>These results suggest a successful EEG which can be used to distinguish between relaxed and focused mental states. Further, with its net cost of approximately $25, this circuit is an extremely cost-effective alternative to commercial EEGs, commonly priced between $80 to $3,000</p>
